            <h1><b> SOFTWARE ENGINEERING.</b></h1>
            <P>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It’s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and Markup language, which is used to define the text document within tags to structure web pages. This language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text</P>
            <p>I was able to download and install git, vscode and i also learnt how software engineering teams work including the internet.</p>
